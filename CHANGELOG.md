## [Unreleased]

  - Add support for excluded columns. These are columns for which
    updates do not cause `GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START` to change, and
    historical rows will not be generated.

    This is not in the standard, but was requested by several people.

## [1.0] â€“ 2019-08-25

### Added

  - Initial release. Supports all features of the SQL Standard
    concerning periods and `SYSTEM VERSIONING`.
